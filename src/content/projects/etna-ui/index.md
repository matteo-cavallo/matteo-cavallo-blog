## Introduction

At Soldo, a company at the forefront of redefining business spending, we understand the importance of efficiency, consistency, and user experience in mobile app development. To address these needs and empower our development team, I undertook a significant project to create a Mobile React Native UI Kit that aligns seamlessly with our mission.

## Project Overview

The project focused on:

- Creating a robust mobile UI kit with excellent developer experience
- Implementing a monorepo architecture for better code organization
- Building a comprehensive design system and component library
- Setting up Storybook for thorough documentation
- Integrating tools like TurboRepo, Husky, and TypeScript for code quality
